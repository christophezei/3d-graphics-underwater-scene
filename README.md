# Steps to run the program

We don't have any additional lib, we used the same as the lab, but in case you don't have them you can run the following command to install them in the project dir run <b> pip install -r dependencies.txt </b><br/>
To launch the program you need to run the following command in src dir <b> python main.py</b><br/>

# What we implemented

1. Modeling an object using hierarchical modeling
2. Mesh modeling
3. Point lighting
4. Specular lighting
5. Texture on objects and skybox
6. KeyFrame animation
7. Procedural animation
8. Skeletal animation 
9. Controlling one element with the keyboard
10. Skybox
11. Fog rendering

# How to move our snake object

1. W/S for back and forth
2. A/D for left and right
3. C/X/Z for rotation
4. E/F up and down

# Who did what 

In our team our main strategy is to brain storm everything together and also in the implementation both of us worked on all the tasks mainly since we had many versions of the application then we refactored everything to this final version.

# Replay the animation in the scene

To replay the animation in the scene hit 'space' key

# Possible extension 

After implementing movable objects and animation we thought of implementing collision detection which is really intresting. it caused us a bit of problems so we priortized our work and skipped this task to finish other features, so we think that this is a really usefull feature to add in the future
